/**
 * With this resource, you can create a tax rate - [Stripe API tax rate  documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api/tax_rates).
 *
 * Tax rates can be applied to invoices, subscriptions and Checkout Sessions to collect tax.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as stripe from "pulumi-stripe";
 *
 * const taxRate = new stripe.TaxRate("taxRate", {
 *     active: true,
 *     country: "AU",
 *     description: "GST Australia",
 *     displayName: "GST",
 *     inclusive: true,
 *     jurisdiction: "AU",
 *     metadata: {},
 *     percentage: 10,
 *     state: "",
 *     taxType: "",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import stripe:index/taxRate:TaxRate rate <tax_rate_id>
 * ```
